          We operate like a modern studio and holding company in one. Under the Manyagi umbrella, we build
          stories, brands, financial engines, and digital infrastructure that work together instead of
          competing for attention. From novels and apparel to media channels, software, and capital strategies,
          every division is designed to feed the rest of the ecosystem and compound over time.
